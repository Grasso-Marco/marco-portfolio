  "tumAbout": "My motivation to learn programming started in school with the goal of creating my own website, which I wanted to use to publish a self-made computer game. \nIn my free time, I studied programming books and was fascinated by the outcome a few lines of code could generate.\nDuring my school times I won two renowned competitions, I got first place in the \"Landeswettbewerb Mathematik Bayern 2011\" and was one of 30 winners in the \"Landeswettbewerb Informatik Bayern 2014\".\nTo improve my knowledge, I decided to study computer science at the internationally acclaimed Technical University of Munich, known to be one of the most successful Universities in the world.\nDuring my time at university, I was able to accomplish my former goal, creating several video games as well as web projects together with my fellow students. \nI graduated with a master's degree, and I'm currently looking forward to using my acquired skills in a professional environment.
